Come to find out, they rest perfectly on the inside of my ear (which I consider to be slightly bigger than the average human ear) and I was able to walk around without them falling out. The player has 2 function modes, "on" and "(something else)", well that (something else) function is like turning on Beats Audio and makes the music even more incredible. Battery life doesn\'t seem to be an issue. They rate the device at 6 hours, but I easily squeezed 9 out of it walking around at work before the red light came on.

But with what everyone does with the phone these days, it's only inevitable that you're going to drop it so protection really is a must. I've dropped this phone 3 times on purpose, probably from a 3-4' range... IN THIS CASE... and it turned out fine. I dropped the original Note II I bought from the same height and the screen cracked instantly. I think that rubber around the case helps alot. Also, the inside is a fine, smooth material that keeps the phone from getting scratched even as you're installing or removing it. My favorite thing about it though, is that the back of the case feels just as smooth as the naked Note II so it's like I'm holding the real deal, just a bit thicker.

But now I have my NEW iPhone 5, put on this case a few days later and just noticed it is beginning to do it again...on a brand new phone!I don't really blame the manufactures of this case, I am sure it was not intentional and much more I blame Apple/iPhone for having such a vulnerable spot on the back of their new phone but either way don't ruin your iPhone by using this case.", u'overall': 2.0, u'summary': u'love the kick stand', u'unixReviewTime': 1357257600, u'reviewTime': u'01 4, 2013'}

When I saw this one, I bought it because it is hard plastic (no pocket lint gets stuck to it!) and it covers the back and edges of the phone. There is also protection around the screen so if I set the phone face down, the glass does not touch the surface. It snaps tightly together and is a slick hard plastic. I really like that the case is thick, not a flimsy thin case, although it does not add much bulk to the phone, The cutouts on the edges in the right places and are cut big enough so the plugs/fingers can still access all of the ports/buttons.

It covers the lip around the front of the screen which is really nice with a phone this expensive. I usually hate the soft silicone cases, but this one wasn't too bad because it has the hard white outer case.

I did love the two backup charger cases that I purchased; however, it's been about one month and the insertion point for the lightening speed charging cord that came with my iPhone 5s no longer stays in the slot. It just falls out it you even breath around it, so you cannot get an accurate charge each time. It's extremely frustrating. I don't know if there was a warranty, so I'll check into that when I get done here. It started with my white cases first and started with the black case about two weeks later.ORIGINAL REVIEW*****We purchased two at the same time - one in black and this one in white. We have been using the cases for over two weeks and have not had any major problems. I had a problem with the white one for a while, but I was able to figure out the problem. I charge the phone right next to my bedside and would turn it upside down to turn of the bright indicator lights. It would charge but not completely for some reason. When I quit flipping it over and put a cloth over the lights, the problem stopped. I would like to add that not all head phone and ear bud connectors will fit. I had a set of Bose ear buds that no longer fit, but my iPhone 5S Apple ear buds have the small insert that will work if you can stand them in your ear. Conclusion: I highly recommend this product for the price.awesome price.", u'overall': 1.0, u'summary': u'Retracting Original Positive Review', u'unixReviewTime': 1393459200, u'reviewTime': u'02 27, 2014'}

I recommended this phone to a couple of family members who bought them almost at the same time frame I bought mine. I am not a paid promoter. I just love samsung products for their durability. After a year of using this phone, the phone developed what I think is battery problem. I would fully charge it and would make or receive a call and the phone would go completely dead. I bought a new battery and the phone works but would sometime hang and I would have to remove the battery and put it back, then turn it on before it works. The other family members also have the same problem and had to change their phone batteries almost at the same time. Is this phone programmed to develop a problem after a year? Does this phone have an expiration date? I know some phones do.

{u'reviewerID': u'AA4ZHKMJ5V6XI', u'asin': u'B0061QFCI2', u'reviewerName': u'Ron M', u'helpful': [0, 0], u'reviewText': u"I first ordered a screen and tool kit from iCracked for about $75. I broke the ribbon cable for the screen and had to order another. I didn't want to pay the high price at iCracked so I took a chance on the screen at Warehouse Gadget Parts. The reviews averaged 3 stars, some good some bad. For $25 it was worth taking a chance. I ordered this on the weekend and had it by Monday afternoon. This is not an easy job replacing one of these screens. I have experience taking apart laptops etc. Taking apart an iPhone is like taking apart a micro laptop. The screws are the tiniest you will ever come across. Easy to damage other ribbon cables/connectors too. Expect to spend a good 3-4 hours your first time around replacing the screen. The most critical point is where you slip the ribbon cables from the screen through a small slot. They will definitely bunch up there!! You need to have bright light and look inside at the ribbon cable from the screen and push it down with the guitar pick that came with the screen. If you don't you will damage the cable. DON'T pull on it at all!!! Very fragile. Also be very careful of other ribbon cables. I damaged the ON/OFF cable and didn't find out until I put the whole phone back together. I had to then take the whole phone apart again to replace the cable. The tools that come with this screen are good enough and the tips are magnetized. The philips screwdriver is the only one that could be better. You might want to get a better tiny philips. The philips screwdriver in the iCracked kit is better but that is the only thing better but not for $40 more. The screen looks as good as my original. I think others who complained about pixels missing etc might have not connected ribbon cables properly or damaged something. This phone is very fragile inside. For your time and money you might be better off just paying $80 for someone else to do it. I am a do it yourselfer and can't resist fixing something myself. I know the next time around I will be better and faster at fixing this phone and I will order from Warehouse Gadget Parts again. One more thing...Order the iphone repair mat because that will make the job a lot easier. Watch the video first and use close up pictures on the internet to see where some very small parts go. The mat is much better than the videos. It is also not magnetized like it should be to hold screws. Good luck and have A LOT of patience. Don't force anything.", u'overall': 5.0, u'summary': u'Buy this screen when doing replacement', u'unixReviewTime': 1377129600, u'reviewTime': u'08 22, 2013'}

The pictures and steps are great for seeing what you need to do and for keeping the screws and parts in some kind of order. I wish it was magnetized in the spots where you need to hold your screws. It says it is magnetized but it didn't hold the screws in place. I think only the back is magnetized like for a sticking to a metal surface. Videos are good but the mat makes it so you don't have to keep playing the video back and forth to see what you need to do.

Phone battery level was at 30% and took about two and a half hours to recharge to 100%. I got two full phone charges before having to recharge the battery pack.  I\'m giving it 4 stars only because I haven\'t had much time to try it out.Added information:  Now that I\'ve had a few months to use this product I wanted to add that it has worked great.  It does take a few hours to fully recharge when it\'s drained but that\'s no big deal.  I have now given this product 5 stars but the biggest reason for that was for the great customer service from Anker.  I bent the mini USB adapter while it was charging my phone.  I went on their web site to buy some extra adapters and could not find them listed, so I contacted their customer service via email.  They are sending me a free replacement because "they value me as a customer".  I was shocked and even made it clear that I would purchase the adapter.  The free replacement is on the way.

But I'm not to sure about everyday use.  The outside of this case is very slick.  If you lay your phone on a slightly slanted surface with this case on it, it will slide off.  Especially if you have it on vibrate and someone calls or texts you.  I'm tempted to try and use a very fine grit sand paper on it just to see if it helps, but at this point I only use this case when I plan to use the kickstand to watch a movie on the phone.  Also, the case fits really really snug.  The first time I removed my phone from the case, it pulled off the on/off/lock button on the side of the phone and I did not know this had happened until a few minutes later.  I was really lucky to find the button and was able to put it back in the phone.  So overall, I would recommend to use only if you intend to use as a backup or if you intend to watch a movie on your phone.

This one in particular is my favorite purchase, though there are areas for minor improvements. The primary impetus in purchasing this case is the &#34;dual color&#34;; it really is something spectacular. What I really like about this case is the velvet-lining on the inside that has softened the impact of the multiple instances where I've dropped my phone. It has provided great protection because nothing has been broken or cracked. In addition, the case completely covers all sides of the phone and raises the screen when faced down. That being said, the case does not cover the hold or volume buttons, the plastic is slightly slippery, and the case shows scratches and discoloration from the inevitable wear-and-tear.I've actually considered repurchasing this case in a another color. I would recommend this if you're looking for a case that receives the attention of both peers and strangers while protecting your phone.", u'overall': 5.0, u'summary': u'Eye-catching and Protective.', u'unixReviewTime': 1387152000, u'reviewTime': u'12 16, 2013'}

I purchase this for my dad who complained that the iPhone was too small. He then complained that this case was too large. There's just no way to make the man happy. But the fact that his phone is in near pristine condition probably does. From what I've been told and my experience, the built-in plastic screen protector makes the touch-screen less convenient. The case also comes with its own holster, which makes this case even larger than it already is.Personally, I would not purchase this for myself because it's waay too large for me.

The product works good if all  you want to do is stream music through your car speakers.  If you also want your phone calls to come through the car speakers it will not.  Let me repeat, the phone features  DO NOT transmit over the bluetooth.  Because this item will only work with my music app I am returning the item.  I tried the device in my house and when I walked more than 10 feet away my music would cut off.  The product also only works if connected to a power source.  The product came with its own usb wall charger, but not a usb car charger.  Due to its limited range a usb car charger would be more practical and the item should be advertised as for the car only.If I had to rate customer service from the seller I would give it 5 stars.  The company responded quickly with each e-mail and even sent me a replacement product when I told them that the item wasn't transmitting my phone calls. The person I e-mailed with assured me that it was supposed to work with the phone features but it appears she was wrong.Written on 2/26/14:In my original review I gave this product 2stars, however I went on to say that if I could give the company 5stars for their great correspondence when dealing with my issues about the product I would have.  Today I received a very shady e-mail from that same company explaining to me that they are a new company and kindly asked me to change my review.  Basically they were asking me to lie to other customers.  I want the company to know that I WILL NOT lie about the quality of their product just so other customers can purchase it under a false expectations.  I will still stick with my 2star rating of the product, however the company just went from 5stars to a 1star in my eyes.  I now sincerely put into question any positive review about this product.  I stand by my original review.  The product worked well in the car, but only worked with music apps and DID NOT work with phone calls.  The product DID NOT work well in the house because after walking more than 10 feet away the signal would drop.
